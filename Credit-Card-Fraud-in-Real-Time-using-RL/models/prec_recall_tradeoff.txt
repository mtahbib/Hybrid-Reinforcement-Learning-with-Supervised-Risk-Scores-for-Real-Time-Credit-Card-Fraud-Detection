Precision–Recall Trade-off
Precision is a key differentiator. At ≈1% FPR:
Baselines: precision 0.09–0.11, meaning most fraud alerts are false positives.

RL (block-only): precision 0.77, meaning a clear majority of alerts are genuine fraud.

Although RL’s recall (0.65) is slightly lower than baselines (0.81–0.85), the precision gain dominates, producing a much higher F1 (0.71). This precision–recall balance reflects the system’s cost-sensitive reward design. Figure 4.4 shows precision and recall comparisons side by side.
